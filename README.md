# E-commerce App (React + TypeScript + Vite)

## Tech Stack

- **React**
- **Vite**
- **TypeScript**
- **Redux Toolkit**
- **React Router**
- **Vitest**
- **React Testing Library**
- **Bootstrap**

## Run the Development Server:
`npm run dev`

## Run Tests
`npx vitest run`

## .env template
`VITE_BACKEND_URL=${VITE_BACKEND_URL}`

## API URL
https://5fc9346b2af77700165ae514.mockapi.io

## dev note:
The filters may seem to not work correctly because the 
product names do not match the brand and models, 
but filtering is being done based on fields that are not visible on the screen.
Therefore, if api is updated with correct data, filtering will work correctly.
